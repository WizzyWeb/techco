- Write short, single-purpose functions (<20 instructions) to improve readability and testability.
- Use Zod for robust data validation, leveraging its type inference for better type safety.
- Prefer immutability by using readonly and as const to prevent unintended state changes.
- Follow SOLID principles in class design to create maintainable and extensible code.
- Use exceptions only for unexpected errors, implementing proper error handling and logging.
