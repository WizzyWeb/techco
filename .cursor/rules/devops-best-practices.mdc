- Use Git with a structured branch strategy (main, dev, feature/*) to manage code changes effectively.
- Follow Conventional Commits for commit messages to enable automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.
- Use Taskfile for automating development and deployment tasks, creating a consistent workflow across the team.
- Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions and deploy via Vercel with ISR for fast, incremental updates.
- Use Supabase Edge Functions for server-side logic, leveraging their scalability and performance benefits.
- Implement monitoring with Sentry for error tracking and Logflare/Datadog for logging, ensuring visibility into application health and performance.
